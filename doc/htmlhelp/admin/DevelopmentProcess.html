There are several roles in the DITA Open Toolkit open source project. Each has different rights and obligations.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../admin/ReleaseLifeCycle.html">DITA Open Toolkit Release management</a></strong><br>
The DITA-OT project uses an agile development process, with roughly four-week development iterations followed by the release of a full test build that includes all new function developed up to that point. Roughly twice a year, a final "stable" build will be released.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../admin/FixesAndFeatures.html">Requesting features and reporting defects</a></strong><br>
Defect reports and feature requests may be submitted at any time through the project page at github. </li>
