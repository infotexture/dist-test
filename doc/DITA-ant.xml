<title>Building DITA output with Ant</title>
<shortdesc>Ant is an open tool that uses the DITA processes to make producing
DITA output easier. </shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p><b>Introduction of Ant </b></p>
<p>DITA provides a set of XSLT scripts for producing different types of documentations
such as: help output in Eclipse, Java Help and HTML Help, web HTML pages and
PDF file. </p>
<p>To make it easier to call these scripts, the DITA distribution now provides
an experimental Ant tool to automatically build the DITA documentations, demos,
and samples. </p>
<p>Ant is a Java-based, open source tool provided by the Apache Foundation
to declare a sequence of build actions. Meanwhile, Ant is well suited for
development builds as well as document builds. </p>
<p>It is unnecessary for Ant to set up a build environment to run the DITA
XSLT scripts. To run the DITA scripts directly, see the <xref href="DITA-readme.xml#DITA-readme"><?Pub Caret?>DITA
Readme</xref> document.</p>
<note>The following instructions and the associated <i>build.xml</i> and <i>ditatargets.xml </i> files
are for the Java 1.4.2, Ant 1.6.2, FOP 0.20.5, and Saxon 6.5.3 releases. These
instructions are likely to need some adjustment for other versions of these
components and for specific environments.</note>
