      <title>DITA OT release 1.4</title>
      <p>Release 1.4 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new 
     requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 
     1.3.1. Available since August 1, 2007</p>
      <p>
      The DITA-OT Release 1.4 contains full support for the OASIS DITA 1.1 standard.
     This completes the preliminary support added in the 1.3 and 1.3.1 versions of
     the toolkit. New and improved items for 1.1 are listed under [Improvements]
     below. Support for the new bookmap standard is available in the latest version
     of the FO plug-in, which uses the "pdf2" transform type; it will be released
     together with or soon after the release of DITA-OT 1.4. The deprecated "pdf"
     transform type has not been updated for the new bookmap.

     Together with DITA 1.1 support, the toolkit development team has improved
     error reporting so that build failures are more accurately reported at the end
     of the build. Error handling will continue to improve in future releases.

     Release 1.4 comes in two versions. The full version contains several external
     packages that are useful or critical to running the toolkit, such as Xalan and
     the XML Catalog resolver. The smaller package contains only core toolkit code.

     NOTE ABOUT DEPRECATED CODE: changes for the new DITAVAL standard required
     a change to code in dita2htmlImpl.xsl. The "flagit" named template is deprecated
     and will not work with the new ditaval format. Overrides to this step should be
     updated to use "start-flagit" and "end-flagit". The flagit template will continue
     to work with the old ditaval but will generate a warning for each call.

      Changes:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Release 1.4 improves the processing of DITA documents using XML Schemas. 
          One was able to process these type of documents in Release 1.3.1 but it 
          meant that the schema location had to have the ablsolute location of the 
          schema in order for the Toolkit properly.</p>
          <p>DITA 1.1 introduces the use of URNs to normatively identify the schemas 
          used for validation.  The URNs have the following desing pattern
          "urn:oasis:names:tc:dita:xsd:&lt;schemaDocument&gt;:1.1". You should use these in 
          as the value for the attribute xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation.</p>
