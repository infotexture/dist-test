  <h1 class="topictitle1">DITA release notes</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">OASIS DITA 1.1 support</h2>
      
      <p>Things to know about OASIS DITA 1.1 support in this release:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>DITA-OT 1.3 provides preliminary processing support for the upcoming OASIS DITA 1.1 specification (see <a href="http://wiki.oasis-open.org/dita/Roadmap_for_DITA_development" target="_blank">http://wiki.oasis-open.org/dita/Roadmap_for_DITA_development</a>). Because the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs and Schemas are fully backwards compatible with the latest DITA 1.0.1 DTDs and Schemas, the 1.3 Toolkit provides the proposed 1.1 materials as the default DTDs for processing. The XML Catalog resolution maps any references for DITA 1.0 doctypes to the 1.1 DTDs, for example. All processing ordinarily dependent on the 1.0 definition continues to work as usual, and any documents that make use of the newer 1.1-based elements or attributes will be supported with specific new processing function (such as base support for the new &lt;data&gt; element). <em>Documents created with the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs are the only ones ever likely to have features that invoke the specific new 1.1-based processing support</em>.<div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Because this support is based on a yet-to-be-approved version of the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 specification, if you choose to investigate any1.1-based function, be aware that the 1.1 implementation in this version of the Toolkit is preliminary and very much forward-looking. Upon final approval of the DITA 1.1 standard, Toolkit developers will, of course, review our implementation to make certain that it conforms to the defined level of reference implementation.</div>
</li>

        <li>Related to the DITA 1.1 preliminary implementation, the much-discussed bookmap updates for DITA 1.1 will be provided as override capabilities for the FO plugin (Idiom's donation). Note that:<ul>
          <li>The FO demo transform code at the 1.2.2 level is still included in the DITA 1.3 package, but is now deprecated.</li>

          <li>To get the FO updates for 1.3, grab the FO plug-in at its next update, which should be shortly after the 1.3 core Toolkit code is released. </li>

          <li>The updated FO plug-in will be usable with FOP as well as with XEP. </li>

        </ul>
</li>

      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Changes</h2>
      
      <p>The DITA Open Toolkit team understands the need for stability in essential APIs in the Toolit. This verson of the toolkit provides some strategic updates that correct some long-overdue faults in the original implementation. Necessarily, there are some changes to note: </p>

      <ol>
        <li><u>Change to build.xml: </u>To make the DITA processing environment more like other Ant-driven build environments, the original build.xml has been renamed as build_demo.xml. The current build.xml in this release is now the normal ANT script entrance for starting a transformation. If you have created Ant tasks that tried to work around the former build.xml architecture, those might need to be revised to take advantage of the separated function.</li>

        <li><u>Change to command line invocations: </u>The "Ant refactoring" exercise for this release has changed some previously documented Ant calls for running demos. This change enables better use of the Ant modules for power users who need to integrate the Toolkit into programming build environments such as Eclipse, but the change affects some documentation. This is a permanent change that should remain stable from now on. Wherever you see an older instruction like "c:\dita-ot&gt;ant all", you now need to indicate the component that contains the demos, so you would type "c:\dita-ot&gt;ant all -f build_demo.xml". </li>

        <li><u>Separation of demo targets from formal component targets: </u>Another effect of the Ant refactoring is that the internal programming targets will now be displayed when you type "ant -p". To see both those programmings targets and the demos that are part of this component, type "c:\dita-ot&gt;ant -p -f build_demo.xml". To run just one of the demos that you see in the resulting list, dita.faq for example, type "c:\dita-ot&gt;ant dita.faq -f build_demo.xml". </li>

        <li><u>Classpath update to enable catalog resolver: </u>This release now includes the Apache catalog resolver for improved lookup of DTDs by any of the Toolkit components. The fullpackage version of the Toolkit sets up these variables for each session. For the regular (smaller) version of the Toolkit, you need to include lib and lib\resource\resolver.jar into your classpath. For example if your CLASSPATH is like: <pre>c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar</pre>
<p>you need to change it to: </p>
<pre>c:\dita-ot\lib;c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar;c:\dita-ot\lib\resolver.jar</pre>
<p>At any time, the full version can be used like a normal installation as long as you update the system variables either in the evironment settings or in a batch file that sets up the shell environment. </p>
</li>

        <li><u>License bundling: </u>To reduce the duplication of builds on Sourceforge in which the only difference was the license provided in each, both the Apache and CPL licenses are included in root directory of the Toolkit. Use the one that applies to your situation.</li>

        <li><u>Two install options: </u>Two download versions are now offered. The smaller one is for updating existing installations or for reuse in embedded applications that already provide the other processing components--business as usual. A new package with "fullpackage" in the name now incorporates the essential processing modules to create a processing environment for new users and evaluators that requires nothing more than to unzip the file into an appropriate directory and then click on a "start" batch file. A new document in its root directory (an output of doc/EvaluateOT.dita, <span class="q">"Evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit (fullpackage version)"</span>) informs new users how to install and use the Toolkit for the first time.</li>

        <li><u>Other enhancements: </u>The public design discussions that fed into the final selection and architectures for this release are documented at the DITA Focus Area in a topic called <span class="q">"DITA OT 1.3 Issues tracking"</span> (<a href="http://dita.xml.org/node/1282" target="_blank">http://dita.xml.org/node/1282</a>).</li>
