Refactored ANT tasks</h1>

<div>

<p>
The ANT tasks are refactored so that developers can easily find the targets
they need and make their own extensions. Developers can still use Java Command
Line as before. Ant Build Script "<samp class="codeph">
conductor.xml</samp>" is marked
as deprecated, but developers can still use it as before. "<samp class="codeph">
build.xml</samp>"
is the renamed version of "<samp class="codeph">
conductor.xml</samp>", and developers
can use it as what they do with "<samp class="codeph">
conductor.xml</samp>". New users
are suggested to use those separated build scripts like "<samp class="codeph">
build_dita2*.xml</samp>".
The original demo ant script "<samp class="codeph">
build.xml</samp>" is renamed to "<samp class="codeph">
build_demo.xml</samp>".
"<samp class="codeph">
build_demo.xml</samp>" should be used to verify the functions of
the toolkit after this release.</p>
