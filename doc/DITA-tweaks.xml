<title>Controls, parameters, tweaks, and gizmos for <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i></title>
<shortdesc>If the available methods can not fully match your own output requirements,
DITA Toolkit supports other ways to customize or enhance the transforms without
having to modify core transforms directly.</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>The <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i> file is the main XHTML processor
to produce the output. You can work with the following variables and parameters
to change the way of processing.</p><p>If you need to make code changes to <i>dita2htmlImpl.xsl</i> to
change a variable value, the preferred mechanism is to create an override
transform and place your changed code in the new transform. </p><p>Here is
an example of an override transform: <ol>
<li>In the <tt>/xsl/</tt> directory, make a copy of the <i>dita2xhtml.xsl</i> file
and change the filename of the copy.</li>
<li>Add your XSLT changes within the new file.</li>
</ol> </p><note type="note"><ul>
<li>Making editing changes to XSLT transforms is not included in this document;
refer to another XSLT reference for guidance.</li>
<li>It is not recommended to edit any of the DITA distribution files, because
your modification might be erased by package updates.</li>
<li>You are responsible for any change you make to DITA transforms. If you
need help, the <xref format="html" href="news://news.software.ibm.com/ibm.software.developerworks.xml.xml">DITA
forum on developerWorks</xref> may be a useful resource.</li>
