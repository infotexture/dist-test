  <div class="body conbody"><div class="abstract">
    <div class="shortdesc">The primary purpose of the DITA Open Toolkit is to transform DITA maps and topics
      into other formats. The toolkit ships with several native transforms, and can be extended to
      support any other output format with by adding a new plug-in.</div>

    <p class="p">The core transforms of the DITA Open Toolkit represent an implementation of all processing
      defined by OASIS in the DITA specification.</p>

  </div>

    <div class="section" id="availabletransforms__preprocess"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Pre-process</h2>
      
      <p class="p">A pre-process is done before the main transformation. The input
        of the pre-process is dita files (maps and topics) and the output of the pre-process is
        often referred to as "normalized" dita files. The pre-process stage resolves several common
        DITA behaviors, such as resolving conref attributes, resolving keyref values, and adding
        links based on the hierarchy and relationship tables in a map. The normalized dita files are
        in a temporary directory. Most DITA transforms use this common pre-process
      setup.</p>
</div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Available core transforms</h2>
      
      <p class="p">A core DITA transform is the basic set of templates
        that support all the elements of a topic. This set is the basis for the following processing
        of any specialized element. Core transforms handle one topic instance, or nested set of
        topics, at a time.</p>

      
    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Invoke the complete transformation</h2>
       
      <p class="p">The complete transformation including pre-process can be executed by an Ant script. There
        are some examples of simple Ant scripts in the directory
        <span class="ph filepath">samples/ant_sample</span>.</p>

  <div class="related-links">
<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2xhtml.html">DITA to XHTML</a></strong><br/>
The XHTML transform was the first transform created for the DITA Open Toolkit; it converts DITA topics into XHTML documents. In addition to the XHTML output, this transform also returns a simple table of contents file named <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>, which is based on the structure of the input map file.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2eclipsehelp.html">DITA to Eclipse help</a></strong><br/>
Eclipse output is an XHTML based output format used by the Eclipse Help system.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2tocjs.html">DITA to TocJS</a></strong><br/>
The "tocjs" transform type is an XHTML based output type that also generates a frameset and a JavaScript based table of contents with expandable and collapsible entries. The tocjs transform type was originally created by Shawn McKenzie as a plug-in to the toolkit, and later bundled with the default distribution.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2pdf.html">DITA to PDF (PDF2)</a></strong><br/>
The DITA-OT transform to PDF was originally created as a plug-in and maintained outside of the main toolkit code. It was created as a more robust alternative to the demo PDF transform in the original toolkit, and thus was known as PDF2. The plug-in was bundled into the default toolkit distribution with release 1.4.3, and is run when setting the transform type to "pdf" or "pfd2".</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2htmlhelp.html">DITA to HTML Help (CHM)</a></strong><br/>
The "htmlhelp" transform type will generate HTML output, along with the control files needed to produce a Microsoft<sup>®</sup> HTML Help file.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2odt.html">DITA to Open Document Type</a></strong><br/>
The "odt" transform type produces output files that use the Open Document format, which is used by tools such as Open Office. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2docbook.html">DITA to Docbook</a></strong><br/>
The Docbook output routine (transform type "docbook) was converts DITA maps and topics into a Docbook output file. Complex DITA markup may not be supported by this process, but the transform does support most common DITA structures.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2troff.html">DITA to Troff</a></strong><br/>
The "troff" transform produces output files for use with the Troff viewer on many Unix-style platforms, particularly for programs such as the Man page viewer. Each DITA topic document generally corresponds to one troff output file. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2word.html">DITA to Rich Text Format</a></strong><br/>
The "wordrtf" transform type will produce an RTF file for use by Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Word.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2eclipsecontent.html">DITA to Eclipse Content</a></strong><br/>
The "eclipsecontent" transform type was originally designed to work with an Eclipse plug-in for dynamically rendering DITA content. It returns Eclipse control files along with normalized DITA files (with preprocessing complete and default attributes included).</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/dita2legacypdf.html">DITA to legacy PDF (Deprecated)</a></strong><br/>
The first few versions of the toolkit came with a demo PDF build, which was eventually replaced by the much more robust PDF Plug-in (also known as PDF2). This code is no longer maintained by the DITA-OT developers.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../readme/DITA-h2d.html">Migrating HTML to DITA</a></strong><br/>
The HTML to DITA migration tool ships in the <span class="ph filepath">plugins</span> directory of     the toolkit, and does not make use of the common toolkit processing for DITA     content.</li>
