<h1 class="title topictitle1">Goals and objectives of the DITA Open Toolkit</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The long term goal of the DITA Open Toolkit is to provide
a high quality        implementation for production level output of
DITA XML content, built in        a professionally-managed project
environment by vetted contributors, and        tested thoroughly for
each release.</p>

<p class="p">The DITA-OT is designed to meet the needs of any user trying to
publish DITA content, from individual users running the tool stand-alone
up to large software products that treat the toolkit as a bundled
(often hidden) library used for DITA publishing. Different <a class="xref" href="../readme/distribution_packages.html" title="DITA-OT is available in three binary packages.">distribution packages</a> are
available to meet the needs of these different audiences.</p>

<p class="p">The DITA Open Toolkit project will keep up to date with the latest
DITA DTD and Schema updates from the OASIS DITA Technical Committee
(owners of the DITA standard). As OASIS produces drafts of future
versions, the DITA-OT will work to create early support for new features
in order to help test the standard.</p>

<p class="p">The project agrees with the Open Source motto of "Release
early and often" to get wide consensus on issues. The project
works with an agile development process, releasing test builds approximately
every month, and encourages feedback on test builds while function
is being developed. Stable releases are typically issued approximately
every six months.</p>
