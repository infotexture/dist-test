The long term goal of the DITA Open Toolkit is to provide a high quality        implementation for production level output of DITA XML content, built in        a professionally-managed project environment by vetted contributors, and        tested thoroughly for each release.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../admin/DevelopmentProcess.html">DITA Open Toolkit Development Process</a></strong><br/>
The DITA Open Toolkit development process is modelled after other popular and successful Open Source projects, notably the Eclipse development process (for definitions and process statements).</li>
