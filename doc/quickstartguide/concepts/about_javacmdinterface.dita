	<title>About the Java Command Line Interface</title>
	<shortdesc>Introduction to using generating documents with Java</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
	  <p>The DITA Open Toolkit provides a Java interface for organizations that automate their
	  document as part of a Java build.  However, the Java interface is a wrapper for the Ant interface,
	  so you still must install Ant.  In addition, only a subset of the Ant properties are supported by
	  the Java interface.
	  </p>
	  <p>Three of the Java properties are required:</p>
	  <ul> 
	  <li><codeph>/i</codeph>:  defines the location of the .ditamap file for your document</li>
	  <li><codeph>/outdir</codeph>: defines the director where the output resides after DITA-OT finishes processing your project</li>
	  <li><codeph>/transtype</codeph>: defines the type of document you want to generate for the project.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For example, the following command instructs DITA-OT to build the samples project as a PDF in the <codeph>out</codeph> directory:</p>
    <p><codeblock>java -jar lib/dost.jar /i:samples/sequence.ditamap /outdir:out /transtype:pdf</codeblock></p>
    <p>See <xref href="../reference/dita-ot_ant_properties.dita" scope="local">Ant Build Properties for DITA-OT</xref> for descriptions of all supported properties.</p>
    <note type="tip">The Java interface for DITA-OT does not currently support multiple threads. If your automated build script requires multi-threaded programming, you must use the Ant interface instead.</note>
