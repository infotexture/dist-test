      <title>DITA OT release 1.3</title>
      <p><b>OASIS DITA 1.1 support</b></p>
      <p>Things to know about OASIS DITA 1.1 support in this release:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>DITA-OT 1.3 provides preliminary processing support for the upcoming OASIS DITA 1.1 specification (see <xref href="http://wiki.oasis-open.org/dita/Roadmap_for_DITA_development" format="html" scope="external">http://wiki.oasis-open.org/dita/Roadmap_for_DITA_development</xref>). Because the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs and Schemas are fully backwards compatible with the latest DITA 1.0.1 DTDs and Schemas, the 1.3 Toolkit provides the proposed 1.1 materials as the default DTDs for processing. The XML Catalog resolution maps any references for DITA 1.0 doctypes to the 1.1 DTDs, for example. All processing ordinarily dependent on the 1.0 definition continues to work as usual, and any documents that make use of the newer 1.1-based elements or attributes will be supported with specific new processing function (such as base support for the new &lt;data&gt; element). <i>Documents created with the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs are the only ones ever likely to have features that invoke the specific new 1.1-based processing support</i>.<note type="important">Because this support is based on a yet-to-be-approved version of the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 specification, if you choose to investigate any1.1-based function, be aware that the 1.1 implementation in this version of the Toolkit is preliminary and very much forward-looking. Upon final approval of the DITA 1.1 standard, Toolkit developers will, of course, review our implementation to make certain that it conforms to the defined level of reference implementation.</note></li>
        <li>Related to the DITA 1.1 preliminary implementation, the much-discussed bookmap updates for DITA 1.1 will be provided as override capabilities for the FO plugin (Idiom&apos;s donation). Note that:<ul>
          <li>The FO demo transform code at the 1.2.2 level is still included in the DITA 1.3 package, but is now deprecated.</li>
          <li>To get the FO updates for 1.3, grab the FO plug-in at its next update, which should be shortly after the 1.3 core Toolkit code is released. </li>
          <li>The updated FO plug-in will be usable with FOP as well as with XEP. </li>
        </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Changes</b></p>
      <p>The DITA Open Toolkit team understands the need for stability in essential APIs in the Toolit. This verson of the toolkit provides some strategic updates that correct some long-overdue faults in the original implementation. Necessarily, there are some changes to note: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><u>Change to build.xml: </u>To make the DITA processing environment more like other Ant-driven build environments, the original build.xml has been renamed as build_demo.xml. The current build.xml in this release is now the normal ANT script entrance for starting a transformation. If you have created Ant tasks that tried to work around the former build.xml architecture, those might need to be revised to take advantage of the separated function.</li>
        <li><u>Change to command line invocations: </u>The &quot;Ant refactoring&quot; exercise for this release has changed some previously documented Ant calls for running demos. This change enables better use of the Ant modules for power users who need to integrate the Toolkit into programming build environments such as Eclipse, but the change affects some documentation. This is a permanent change that should remain stable from now on. Wherever you see an older instruction like &quot;c:\dita-ot&gt;ant all&quot;, you now need to indicate the component that contains the demos, so you would type &quot;c:\dita-ot&gt;ant all -f build_demo.xml&quot;. </li>
        <li><u>Separation of demo targets from formal component targets: </u>Another effect of the Ant refactoring is that the internal programming targets will now be displayed when you type &quot;ant -p&quot;. To see both those programmings targets and the demos that are part of this component, type &quot;c:\dita-ot&gt;ant -p -f build_demo.xml&quot;. To run just one of the demos that you see in the resulting list, dita.faq for example, type &quot;c:\dita-ot&gt;ant dita.faq -f build_demo.xml&quot;. </li>
        <li><u>Classpath update to enable catalog resolver: </u>This release now includes the Apache catalog resolver for improved lookup of DTDs by any of the Toolkit components. The fullpackage version of the Toolkit sets up these variables for each session. For the regular (smaller) version of the Toolkit, you need to include lib and lib\resource\resolver.jar into your classpath. For example if your CLASSPATH is like: <pre>c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar</pre><p>you need to change it to: </p><pre>c:\dita-ot\lib;c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar;c:\dita-ot\lib\resolver.jar</pre><p>At any time, the full version can be used like a normal installation as long as you update the system variables either in the evironment settings or in a batch file that sets up the shell environment. </p></li>
        <li><u>License bundling: </u>To reduce the duplication of builds on Sourceforge in which the only difference was the license provided in each, both the Apache and CPL licenses are included in root directory of the Toolkit. Use the one that applies to your situation.</li>
        <li><u>Two install options: </u>Two download versions are now offered. The smaller one is for updating existing installations or for reuse in embedded applications that already provide the other processing components--business as usual. A new package with &quot;fullpackage&quot; in the name now incorporates the essential processing modules to create a processing environment for new users and evaluators that requires nothing more than to unzip the file into an appropriate directory and then click on a &quot;start&quot; batch file. A new document in its root directory (an output of doc/EvaluateOT.dita, <q>Evaluating the DITA Open Toolkit (fullpackage version)</q>) informs new users how to install and use the Toolkit for the first time.</li>
        <li><u>Other enhancements: </u>The public design discussions that fed into the final selection and architectures for this release are documented at the DITA Focus Area in a topic called <q>DITA OT 1.3 Issues tracking</q> (<xref href="http://dita.xml.org/node/1282" format="html" scope="external">http://dita.xml.org/node/1282</xref>).</li>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.2</title>
      <p>DITA open toolkit Release 1.2 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 1.1.2.1.</p>
      <p><b>Important Change</b> DITA-OT 1.2 offers new error handling and logging system. If you invoke your transformation by using java command line where new error handling and logging system is mandatory, you need to set the <varname>CLASSPATH</varname><xref href="installguide/settingenvironmentvariables.xml">Environment Variable</xref> for <codeph>dost.jar</codeph>. If you invoke your transformation by using an ant script, you need to do one more step after the setting above. That is adding a parameter in your command to invoke an ant script. For example, use <userinput>ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml -logger org.dita.dost.log.DITAOTBuildLogger</userinput> instead of <userinput>ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml</userinput> to start a transformation defined in ant script file ant\sample_xhtml.xml. </p>
      <p>
        <b>New Functions</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>New plugin archiecture</b>
            <p>DITA Open Toolkit 1.2 provides a new function to help users to download, install and use plug-ins and help developers create new plug-ins for DITA Open Toolkit.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transformation to wordrtf</b>
            <p>DITA Open Toolkit 1.2 provides DITA to Word transforming function to transform DITA source files to output in <tm trademark="Microsoft" tmowner="Microsoft Corporation" tmtype="reg" tmclass="special">Microsoft</tm> Word RTF file.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>HTML to DITA migration tool</b>
            <p>DITA Open Toolkit 1.2 provides a HTML to DITA migration tool, which migrates HTML files to DITA files. This migration tool originally comes from the developerWorks publication of Robert D. Anderson&apos;s how-to articles with the original h2d code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Problem determination and log analysis</b>
            <p>In DITA Open Toolkit 1.2, a new logging method is supported to log messages both on the screen and into the log file. The messages on the screen present user with the status information, warning, error, and fatal error messages. The messages in the log file present user with more detailed information about the transformation process. By analyzing these messages, user can know what cause the problem and how to solve it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open DITA User Guide for conditional processing</b>
            <p>In DITA Open Toolkit 1.2, a new user guide which can help users to use conditional processing is added to toolkit document.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Include the OASIS version langref</b>
            <p>In DITA Open Toolkit 1.2, a new OASIS version of language reference for DITA standard is added to toolkit document.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Document adapt to OASIS DITA 1.0.1 DTDs</b>
            <p>DITA DTD files are updated to 1.0.1 version in DITA Open Toolkit 1.2.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1.2.1</title>
      <p>Release 1.1.2.1 is a full build to provide an urgent fix to fix the following critical problem which users found in release 1.1.2.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>SF Bug 1345600 The build process failed when run &quot;Ant all&quot; in release 1.1.2</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>For this fix, we have restored all the source DITA files in &apos;doc&apos; and directories in the binary packages.</p>
      <p>Note that the original parameter &quot;args.eclipse.toc&quot; in &quot;Ant tasks and script&quot; was separated to &quot;args.eclipsehelp.toc&quot; for DITA-to-Eclipse help transformation, and &quot;args.eclipsecontent.toc&quot; for DITA-to-dynamic Eclipse content transformation.</p>
      <p>Another issue is that we found there is a mismatch in the document and the toolkit behavior when you are trying to use the following command <codeblock>ant -f conductor.xml -propertyfile ${dita.temp.dir}/property.temp.</codeblock> Now we have updated the documentation. Please refer to the topic &apos;Building DITA output with Java command line&apos; on our website for more details.</p>
      <p>These updates do not affect standard operation of the toolkit. The main goal of this minor release to enable new users of the toolkit to run the installation verification tests without failure.</p>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1.2</title>
      <p>Release 1.1.2 is a maintenance release to fix defects and make patches based on release 1.1.1. </p>
      <p>But there are certain limitations and unfixed bugs in this release, such as, <ul>
          <li>Bug 1343963 Blank index.html generated for ditamap contains only reltabe</li>
          <li>Bug 1344486 java.io.EOFException thrown out when reading ditaval file</li>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1.1</title>
      <p>Release 1.1.1 is a maintenance release to fix defects and make patches based on release 1.1. </p>
      <p>For patch 1284023, we are changing the name of the jar lib file from dost1.0.jar back to dost.jar because we believe we need to keep the jar file name consistent through various releases.</p>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.1</title>
      <p>Release 1.1 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 1.0.2.</p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Adaptation to the new OASIS DITA standard</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 implements the new OASIS DITA 1.0 standard for DITA DTDs and Schemas.</p>
            <p>DTDs of the previous release locate in the directory <b>dtd/dita132</b> and schemas of the previous release locate in the directory <b>schema/dita132</b>. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transformation to troff</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 supports new troff output. Troff output looks like Linux man page output.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>XML catalog support</b>
            <p>An XML catalog, which can consist of several catalog entry files, is a logical structure that describes mapping information between public IDs and URLs of DTD files. A catalog entry file is an XML file that includes a group of catalog entries. If you want to know more about XML catalog, please refer<xref href="xmlcatalog.xml">XML Catalog</xref>.</p>
            <p>A catalog entry can be used to locate a unified resource identifier (URI) reference for a certain resource such as a DTD file. An external entity&apos;s public identifier is used for mapping to the URI reference. The URI of any system identifier can be ignored.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Topicref referring to a nested topic</b>
            <p>The href attribute of the topicref is extended to quote a nested topic in a dita file.</p>
            <p>For example, in previous releases, href attribute is set like: href = &quot;xxx.dita&quot;; in release 1.1, href attribute can be set like: href = &quot;xxx.dita#abc.dita&quot;.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Globalization support</b>
            <p>Release 1.1 supports over 20 popular languages within the content of dita files. And it also provides translation function for DITA keywords to over 20 languages. Currently this globalization support fully applies to Eclipse Help and XHTML transformations, and partially applies to other transformations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accessibility support</b>
            <p>Accessibility support is now partially applies to PDF and XHTML transformations.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Eclipse Content Provider Support</b>
            <p>Please refer to <xref href="eclipseconprov.xml">Eclipse Content Provider</xref> for detail information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Index information in output</b>
            <p>The output of HTML Help and Java Help transformations contain index information now.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mapref function</b>
            <p>Mapref refers to a special usage of the <tt>&lt;topicref&gt;</tt> element as a reference to another ditamap file. This allows you to manage the overall ditamap file more easily. A large ditamap file can thus be broken down into several ditamap files, making it easier for the user to manage the overall logical structure. On the other hand, this mechanism also increases the reusability of those ditamap files. If you want to know more about mapref, please refer <xref href="mapref.xml">Mapref</xref>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>TOC generation for Eclipse Help transformation</b>
            <p>TOC generation now supported in transformation to Eclipse Help. Eclipse.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Helpset generation for Java Help transformation</b>
            <p>Helpset generation now supported in transformation to Java Help.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>New parameters supported in Java commands</b>

      <title>DITA OT release 1.0</title>
      <p>The initial release of the Open Sourced DITA Toolkit introduces major architectural changes from the previous, developerWorks version of the Toolkit. </p>
      <p>
        <b>New features</b>
        <ol>
          <li>A new, Java-based processing architecture that supports single-threaded execution throughout.</li>
          <li>Ant-based orchestration of the processing environment, from preprocessing to transformation to any required post-processing.</li>
          <li>A pre-processor core that supports conditional processing and conref resolution.</li>
          <li>Map-driven processing that generates links for transformed topics.</li>
          <li>A new DITA to HTML transform that replaces the previous topic2html_Impl.xsl core transform. This new core is based on requirements for high-volume usage within IBM for the past several years.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Ant-driven processing means that you can integrate the DITA processing tools into a seamless pipeline within supportive environments such as Eclipse.</p>
      <p>The DTDs and Schemas in this version are based on those in the previous dita132 package with bug fixes. The DITA OS Toolkit will later support the OASIS 1.0 specification in its public review form.</p>
