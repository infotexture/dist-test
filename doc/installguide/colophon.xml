  <title>About the installation guide</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>This set of information was produced using DITA methodologies. The 
      center point of the information within this guide was created using 
      tasks. We have also included concept and reference topics to support 
      these tasks. </p>
    <p>If you are interested in using this information set but need to 
      eliminate some of the tasks, such as HTML Help or Java Help installation, 
      you can filter them out in the map using a .xmlval file or the print 
      attribute. </p>
    <p>We slightly modified the HTML style sheet delivered with the DITA open 
      toolkit by changing the spacing between steps and enhancing the output 
      format of the tables. We made these changes to the stylesheet by adding 
      CSS and basic html tags to the stylesheet that is delivered with the open 
      toolkit. The DITA Toolkit was used to produce this information. In 
      production, we used the HTML Help .chm build file to produce our 
      output.</p>
